# ML_samples
Implementations of some simple machine learning models:

- `lr.py` consists of implementation of logistic regression (or 1-layer neural network for binary classification)

- `nnb_2.py` consists of implementation of 2-layer neural network (1 hidden layer) for binary classification (0 or 1)

- `nnb_k.py` consists of implementation of k-layer neural network for binary classification (0 or 1)
